<h2>Important info</h2>
From December 14, 2021, CDM android_generic_4464 is gradually ceasing to work on most major VODs. Accordingly, since the script is based on this CDM, from this day on without replacing the CDM with the "non-leaked" one it will not work. How to fix this can be found in Google (with the proper level of knowledge what to look for, of course). </br> 
If you need script modification for some specific service, you can always write me on telegram @medvm. Since paypal doesn't work here anymore, I use Tether TRC20 wallet.

Works only if the site does not require specific json-formatted data in the license request. 
And if it requires and you want to add its support, write me [on telegram](https://t.me/medvm) and we'll figure something out. Nothing is unhackable.

2. Server did not issue a license, as it requires additional json-formatted data:
